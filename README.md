💡 Key Insights

Sales exhibit clear seasonal trends with peak performance in specific months.

Technology category contributes the highest revenue, while Furniture shows lower profitability.

Tables sub-category is loss-making due to high discounting.

Discounts above ~30% are strongly associated with reduced profit or losses.

A small group of customers and products contribute disproportionately to total revenue.

Certain regions consistently outperform others in sales contribution.

📌 Business Recommendations

Optimize discount strategy, especially for loss-making sub-categories like Tables.

Focus marketing and inventory efforts on high-profit categories.

Strengthen presence in high-performing regions and investigate underperforming markets.
